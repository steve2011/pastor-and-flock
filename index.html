                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Opinion from Adeoba Morenikeji Olufemi</h2>
                            
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Faith without work is dead. There should be a corresponding action in line with faith.
When the Christian gospel came to Africa, the missionaries saw two vital areas of deficiencies – hospitals and schools. 
They filled these gaps. Today, directly or indirectly, we have all benefited from it.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Today, we have a major problem – unemployment. Instead of filling this gap, we are taking advantage of it.
We gather the unemployed and “prophesy” jobs to them. We give them stickers, sell “holy water”, tell them to sow and expect
a harvest convincing their gullible mind to “work” for the Lord and that breakthrough is coming… All these we do to manipulate
 and exploit the vulnerable.</p>
                            
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">When we sow, instead of our money to be invested into ventures like agriculture that would alleviate the sufferings of the weak ones 
among us, we channel the money to an atheist in Germany who designed MOG’s customized car.
</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We channel the money to Buddhists in China, where we buy our building materials. We direct the money to a gay in 
America who produced the sound system and lighting system.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
We channel the money to a Muslim in Dubai who did the interior decoration of our “magnificent” church building…what a Capital Flight!
Why are we crying of poverty and for a breakthrough? The God that I know responds to work wherever he sees man doing something 
to advance humanity, be it a Hindu, Gay, Buddhist, atheist etc.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I don’t want to start mentioning names, neither do I want to indict any person. But just imagine Living Faith Church 
going into rice production, RCCG going into cassava production, Foursquare into pepper & tomato, Christ Embassy into maize, 
Lord’s Chosen into yams, Catholics into millets, MFM going into plantain, etc. What will become of this great nation?</p>

                                 A shepherd’s primary responsibility is the safety and welfare of the flock.
The sheep recognize the voice of the shepherd. They follow him (or her). 
The shepherd protects his flock and would give his life for them.

                           <h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3>
<p>13 That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. 2 Such large crowds gathered around him that he
 got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. 3 Then he told them many things in parables,
 saying: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds
 came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil 
was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</p>
 <p>7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop
—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown. 9 Whoever has ears, let them hear.”</p>

<p>10 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”</p>

<p>11 He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. </p>
<p>12 Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</p> 
<p>13 This is why I speak to them in parables:</p>

<p>“Though seeing, they do not see;
    though hearing, they do not hear or understand.</p>

<p>14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:</p>

<p>“‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding;
    you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.</p>
<p>15 For this people’s heart has become calloused;
    they hardly hear with their ears,
    and they have closed their eyes.</p>
<p>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
    hear with their ears,
    understand with their hearts
and turn, and I would heal them</p>
